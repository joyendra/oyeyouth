        <p>The Organization for Youth Empowerment (OYE) is a volunteer-run youth-initiative founded in 2019, inspired by a vision of a society where youth have a powerful voice and the knowledge and resources to use that voice to create positive change in their lives and their communities. We believe that everyone has the right to have access to information free from judgment in a manner that helps them understand the choices available to them.
          The members, volunteers, and any other parties associated with OYE or any of its regional chapters do not claim to have legally recognized qualifications or authority to offer diagnosis or medical advice of any nature.
          We act as guides and supporters to those who may reach out to us. While we try our level best to ensure that all knowledge imparted during any activity of OYE is factually accurate and suitable for our audience, for which we have medical professionals on our board, our services are offered in good faith and any advice or instruction provided in any interaction should not be considered a substitute for professional advice. It is always better to take the help of doctors, or relevant medical professionals; we can only help guide you to a certain extent or connect you with a professional.
          All donation drives conducted by OYE are in kind only. No monetary donations are accepted by any representative of OYE, or it’s regional chapters for any purpose. Any person who donates any amount to OYE has the right to know where their donations were sent and may send an email requesting this information if they desire so.
          OYE does not in any way promote or encourage promiscuous behaviour among our audience, especially minors and is purely a knowledge-oriented initiative. We do not accept any responsibility for the consequences of a client’s use of our services — either beneficial or otherwise. In no event shall OYE or its members be liable to any person(s) for loss or damage of any kind, which may occur as a result of our services. Please note that OYE requires all people, including schools, NGOS and any other party we provide services to, to read the above Disclaimer.

                <p class="light">OYE’s core youth-led programs create spaces for adolescents to engage with each other, develop skills and give back to their communities. We believe that empowered and engaged young people are the key to building stronger, more resilient communities.
                  Our hands-on, youth-led approach ensures that our projects respond to the realities of the youth we engage and creates opportunities for them to develop leadership, creative and critical thinking, decision-making and effective communication, among other significant life skills through our worksheets and activities.

          <h2>Let’s be OURSELVES!</h2>
          <p class="white-text">Facilitating dialogue circles to foster open discussion and reflection on issues that impact their health and well-being and driving advocacy efforts to implement comprehensive “sexuality” education in local public schools and NGOs, OYE aims to spread awareness about gender identity, physical and emotional attraction and biological sex that influence a person’s gender expression. Our workshop content is age specific.From “Good touch-Bad touch” for the toddlers to “Gender dysphoria and Sexual identity issues” for young adults,  the workshops are completely inclusive of the LGBTQA+ community providing the adolescents a safe environment inculcating the feeling of inclusion, support and acceptance among them. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item amber white-text" href="#">
          <h2>Let’s be REAL!</h2>
          <p class="white-text">Adding a new dimension to the “Let’s Be Ourselves!” project, we facilitate gender and masculinity workshops, using dialogue circles and participatory methods to engage adolescents and young people in deconstructing and reconstructing masculinity often engaging them in discussions about their concepts about bodily changes which must not affect their behaviour. We dig deeper into the gender expression, catering to different gender bias issues existing around us like toxic masculinity and femininity, social norms that create a certain image that a man or woman must portray to be accepted in the society and much more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item green white-text" href="#!">
          <h2>Let’s get Mental!</h2>
          <p class="white-text">During the teenage years striking changes take place in the body as well as the brain. Youth are particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges including – depression, anxiety, ADHD, self-harm, eating disorders and more.
            You are not alone. We at OYE offer a convenient and safe place for teens to connect, share stories and encouragement. Positive social support is a critical component to developing into a healthy adult. Members of our OYE support group have access to dedicated activity streams, forums and chat rooms. In addition, members can participate in the larger wellness challenge through our inspirational wellness tools posted regularly on our social media tabs — fun-illustrated wellness tracker, friend reminders, mood mapping and lot more.
            We believe that individuals become empowered to help themselves and others when they feel a part of something larger. Our young volunteers, because of the less age gap bond with the children forming peer-to-peer support groups helping them combat mental health challenges and/or difficult family dynamics.
            One of the main benefits of our young team counselling for children is that it teaches them how to effectively manage emotional distress and anxiety – by themselves. More specifically, children learn how to prevent panic attacks, and deal with anxiety in healthier ways.
            Some children are exposed to disturbing situations that traumatize them – events no child should bear witness to or experience. The negative and heart-breaking effects of trauma can include shock, disbelief, detachment, emotional or social numbness, fear, anxiety, and depression. 
            OYE gives these special children an outlet to share their feelings, fears, and concerns.
            In other words, we can give these children a voice – one, in which they can talk about what happened to them and how it made them feel then and how it makes them feel now. We aim to encourage these individuals to share their feelings, regardless of what they are, instead of keeping them bottled up inside.
            Our friendly and informal counselling can help these children understand that they are not to blame for what happened to them. They are survivors – not victims or perpetrators.

          <h2>Let’s Log Out!</h2>
          <p class="white-text">“You’re always on your phone!” the one dialogue ever teenager’s mother has in common. Most of us at OYE are ourselves teens, and we relate with the thousands of other kids who’ve heard this at least once from their friends and family. 
            With a message to plug Back into life, this project offers several workshops, each beginning with the assessment and treatment of on-line addictions. The workshops cover the use and abuse of digital devices such as smartphones, cell phones, video game consoles and portable gaming/music devices. Special attention is paid to the most common forms of Internet and Digital problems, such as sex (including pornography and cybersex), gaming (including MMPORG’s, game consoles and handheld devices) and on-line gambling. Other issues covered include shopping, auctioning, excessive emailing and compulsive surfing.

            <h2>Let’s get Healthy!</h2>
            <p class="white-text">Our Wellness Workshops are interactive programs designed for people of all ages, with topics ranging from balanced diet for the kids to eating disorders and body image for the youth. We, with this project define being healthy and beautiful in the literal sense and not the definition created by others. The workshops not only establish the fact that fitness is essential but also how being fit and fat at the same time is healthy because fat is an adjective, not an insult. Our discussions revolve around different eating disorders, obesity, malnutrition, having a better sense of nutrition  and age appropriate diet plans to help people understand we are what we eat. We also focus on related issues like hormonal imbalances causing weight gain and other factors that may define your body type.</p>

She has proved her debating and speaking skills in many national level debates and youth parliaments, showcasing her strong opinionated nature.
